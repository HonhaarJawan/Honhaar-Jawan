      "The course begins with an introduction to Visual Studio, debugging techniques, and the basic building blocks of C# such as data types, control structures, and arrays. You'll then progress to understanding more complex concepts like classes, objects, constructors, method overloading, and the static keyword. As you move forward, the course delves into advanced OOP principles, including inheritance, method overriding, sealed classes, abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism.",
      "In addition to core OOP concepts, the course covers essential topics like exception handling, delegates, and asynchronous programming with async and await. Each module is designed to provide hands-on experience through practical exercises, ensuring that you not only learn the theory but also apply it in real-world scenarios.",
      "By the end of this course, you'll have a solid foundation in C# and .Net Core, enabling you to develop high-quality applications and tackle complex programming challenges with confidence.",
